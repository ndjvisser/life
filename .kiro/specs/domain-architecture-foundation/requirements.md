# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Domain Architecture Foundation establishes the core architectural patterns and infrastructure for the LIFE personal dashboard system. This foundation implements Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles within a modular monolith architecture, providing clean separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability. The architecture enables the system to scale from a personal tool to a comprehensive Life OS platform while maintaining code quality and development velocity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Modular Monolith with Bounded Contexts

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear architectural boundaries between different domains, so that I can work on features independently without breaking other parts of the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is structured THEN each domain SHALL be organized as a bounded context with clear boundaries
2. WHEN contexts are defined THEN they SHALL include: stats, quests, achievements, journals, skills, integrations, analytics, and dashboard
3. WHEN code is written THEN there SHALL be no direct model imports between contexts
4. WHEN building the system THEN import violations SHALL cause build failures through automated linting
5. WHEN contexts need to communicate THEN they SHALL use domain events or service interfaces only

### Requirement 2: Domain-Driven Design Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want business logic separated from framework concerns, so that the core domain remains testable and framework-independent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each context is structured THEN it SHALL follow the layered architecture: domain/, application/, infrastructure/, interfaces/
2. WHEN domain logic is written THEN it SHALL have no Django framework dependencies
3. WHEN business rules are implemented THEN they SHALL reside in pure Python domain entities and services
4. WHEN data access is needed THEN it SHALL use the repository pattern with abstract interfaces in domain layer
5. WHEN external systems are accessed THEN they SHALL use adapter patterns with domain interfaces

### Requirement 3: Canonical Domain Event System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reliable event system for decoupled communication, so that contexts can react to changes without tight coupling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events are defined THEN they SHALL follow the canonical schema from the domain events catalog
2. WHEN events are published THEN they SHALL include event_id, timestamp, and semantic version
3. WHEN events are processed THEN handlers SHALL specify minimum supported event version
4. WHEN event schemas evolve THEN backward compatibility SHALL be maintained for at least 2 major versions
5. WHEN events are dispatched THEN they SHALL support both synchronous and asynchronous processing
6. WHEN events are serialized THEN they SHALL be JSON-compatible for persistence and debugging

### Requirement 4: Service Layer Pattern

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear service boundaries for business operations, so that I can orchestrate complex workflows and maintain transaction boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business operations are performed THEN they SHALL go through application service methods
2. WHEN services are implemented THEN they SHALL orchestrate domain entities and publish domain events
3. WHEN cross-context operations are needed THEN they SHALL use service interfaces, not direct model access
4. WHEN commands are processed THEN they SHALL be separated from queries (CQRS pattern)
5. WHEN transactions are needed THEN they SHALL be managed at the service layer

### Requirement 5: Repository Pattern Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want data access abstracted from business logic, so that I can test domain logic without database dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data access is needed THEN it SHALL use repository interfaces defined in the domain layer
2. WHEN repositories are implemented THEN concrete implementations SHALL reside in the infrastructure layer
3. WHEN domain entities are persisted THEN they SHALL be mapped to/from Django models in the infrastructure layer
4. WHEN queries are complex THEN they SHALL be encapsulated in repository methods with clear names
5. WHEN testing domain logic THEN it SHALL be possible using mock repositories without database access

### Requirement 6: Development Tooling and Quality Enforcement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated tools to enforce architectural constraints, so that the codebase maintains quality and consistency over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN mypy strict type checking SHALL pass for all contexts
2. WHEN imports are made THEN architectural boundary violations SHALL be detected and prevented
3. WHEN tests are run THEN domain tests SHALL execute without Django test database
4. WHEN development server runs THEN domain layer changes SHALL hot-reload without full restart
5. WHEN CI/CD runs THEN architecture compliance SHALL be validated automatically

### Requirement 7: Privacy-by-Design Foundation

**User Story:** As a user, I want my personal data protected by design, so that I can trust the system with sensitive life information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN personal data is processed THEN explicit consent SHALL be required for each purpose
2. WHEN events contain personal data THEN privacy compliance SHALL be validated before processing
3. WHEN data is stored THEN data minimization principles SHALL be applied
4. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN all personal data access SHALL be logged
5. WHEN features are developed THEN privacy impact assessment SHALL be conducted

### Requirement 8: Testing Strategy Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing capabilities, so that I can confidently refactor and extend the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN domain logic is tested THEN it SHALL use fast unit tests without framework dependencies
2. WHEN services are tested THEN integration tests SHALL validate cross-layer interactions
3. WHEN user workflows are tested THEN BDD scenarios SHALL cover end-to-end functionality
4. WHEN APIs are tested THEN contract testing SHALL prevent breaking changes
5. WHEN architecture is tested THEN dependency rules SHALL be automatically validated

### Requirement 9: Observability and Monitoring Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want visibility into system behavior, so that I can debug issues and monitor performance effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests are processed THEN structured logging SHALL include trace IDs for correlation
2. WHEN events are published THEN they SHALL be logged with full context for debugging
3. WHEN external APIs are called THEN instrumentation SHALL track performance and errors
4. WHEN health checks are performed THEN each bounded context SHALL report its status
5. WHEN metrics are collected THEN business KPIs SHALL be tracked alongside technical metrics
