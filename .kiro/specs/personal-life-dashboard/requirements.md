# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Personal Life Dashboard is a modular monolith, RPG-inspired web application that provides users with a comprehensive view of their personal development journey. Building on the existing LIFE platform, this enhancement expands the system to track detailed life metrics across health/wealth/relationships, enhanced quest categorization, skills development, achievements, and personal reflections through journaling. The architecture follows Domain-Driven Design principles with clear bounded contexts, service layers, and domain events to maintain modularity while avoiding premature microservice complexity.
