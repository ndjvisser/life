- Quests, Achievements, and Skills should register themselves via a class registry or discovery pattern (not hardcoded imports).
- Avoid cross-referencing unrelated modules (e.g., no calls from Skills to RomanceQuests).
- Ensure that new modules support `to_dict()` or `serialize()` for UI rendering.
- Every new module must include:
  - At least one integration test.
  - One display view or dashboard component.
  - Basic test coverage for model + serializer.
