- All stat models must inherit from one of the following base classes:
  - `BaseStat`
  - `CoreStat` → for RPG stats (STR, INT, etc.)
  - `LifeStatCategory` → for grouped stats (Health, Wealth, Relationships)
- Use abstract base models for reusable logic (e.g., timestamping, calculated fields).
- Keep model logic pure — avoid direct state mutation or business logic in models.
- Stats with dynamic values must expose `calculate_value()` methods.

Examples:
```python
class Strength(CoreStat): ...
class PhysicalHealth(LifeStat): ...

```
